yo bro i'm just adding the list of mods that we need to do after this course is completed
<ol>
  <li> Stop cross-side scripting attacks
  <li> Find a proper alternative to Proof of Work
  <li> Add support for custom messages (chats/tweets/posts etc XD, should sumppot images/audio/video in future)
  <li> Add functionality for Non-fungible tokens
  <li> Add a feature which allows the syncing of blockchains through ANY channels (not just get/post requests, can even involve - )
    <ol>
      <li> Whatsapp/facebook/ other social media for communication (might need web scraping)
      <li> Even a telephone call (XD) (automatic call handling/ message reading/sending) 
      <li> Or even word of mouth commuincation
      <li> Anything actually
    </ol>
  <li> Start project seraph (post quantum cryptography attempts)
  <li> Stronger the encryption, larger the encrypted data becomes => setting up variable encryption that gives a mixed choice of speed or security 
  <li> Create a blacklist
  <li> Name each major feature (mining, communication/sync, security, search etc) using a popular culture reference
</ol>
